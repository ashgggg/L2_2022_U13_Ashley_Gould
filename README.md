# fonts

# main
+ I will be using Breeze Sans font because it is used by Samsung and Samsung is a popular phone company.
+ I searched for a website called fontesk and downloaded the font
+ https://fontesk.com/breeze-sans-font-family/
+ Also I might use Arial because it's popular   



# second option
+ The second font I will be using is callled Roboto because it was developed by google.
+ I used Google fonts to get this font
+ https://fonts.google.com/?query=Roboto

# review
+ Aiden
The buttons look neat and clean, could do with highlight when hovering over.
The Phone products look nice, It's very visible and prominent, missing a buy button and clear price tag.

Overall 8/10, could do with improvements.

+ Nojus
Website looks modern clean and professional, 
Would look better with highlight when hovering over products as well as a login/register and basket/cart
+ Harry
While providing a variety of the latest flagship phones, the site contains a lot of errors. From misspellings to various inaccuracies in the spec sheets. Some buttons take you to the wrong page and the font doesn't fit that of an average online storefront.
